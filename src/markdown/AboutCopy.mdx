[Sanzo Wada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanzo_Wada) (1883â€“1967) was an artist, teacher, and designer. In 1927 he founded the Japan Standard Color Association (present-day Japan Color Research Institute). During the 1930s he created a six volumne book work *A Dictionary of Color Combinations*, a collection of 348 of curated colour combinations.

This website gathers together the contents of this work and reinterprets it as an interactive and functional tool. It builds upon work by [Dain M. Blodorn Kim](https://github.com/dblodorn/sanzo-wada) ([who created a similar site](https://sanzo-wada.dmbk.io)) and uses the color data as interpreted by [Matt DesLauriers](https://github.com/mattdesl/dictionary-of-colour-combinations).

The design and build is by [ben elwyn](https://elwyn.co).
